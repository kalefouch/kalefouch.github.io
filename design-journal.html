        <h2>week one</h2>
        <p>prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>response: I hope to be a lot more confident than I am at the start. Originally I had a loooooot of butterflies, but after doing HW1 I realized I'm somewhat familiar with HTML due to my tumblr days when I was 12-14 years old (lol.) I get nervous about missing steps and having to go back and fix wonky things, but as this term trucks through I'm sure I'll learn and improve. I'm excited to start the first steps of coding!</p>

        <h2>week two</h2>
        <p>prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter? </p>
        <p>response: For project 1 I was debating on doing a website for kava (a Pasifika ceremonial drink,) or a topic with bright pastels and vintage aesthetics. I decided on anime shows from the 1990's, and I'm super excited to flesh out how it will look, especially after I pieced my moodboard together. I want to base it off of 90's pop magazines, while sewing in details from anime, such as images, subtitles, emotes, etc. </p>
